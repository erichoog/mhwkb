# FAQ

**Q: While, I'm probably not really knowledgeable enough to contribute much
if anything to your github project, What else or how else could others
maybe help with it? (apart from code or content)**

*A:* General feedback about from a user's perspective. And for those who
don't have time to edit the .md files and submit pull requests: there's
[a ticket where links can just be pasted in](https://github.com/andy5995/mhwkb/issues/27).
All that's required is a GitHub account for that. I also have an email
address displayed on the README for those who don't have a GitHub
account and choose not to get one.

Anyone is also welcome to join the [chat in the Slack Workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/mhwkb/shared_invite/enQtMjU3MjcwMTk4NjYzLTA0ZDc2YjAwMDJiNTU1YTBmYTViNmQ5MTdjOTk2MDA2MDMyMzNiYjU4ZWIzMTZlNmU4ZjFhNDg1MjQ5OGQyMjI).
There are different channels set up for development, help using git,
#random for any type of chat, and a #music channel. People can
participate in the chat, or observe how things are done, the process
for developing a project.

There's a channel to suggest links for the KB, or discuss if links
aren't suitable. For instance, if they are too indirectly related to
mental health, or have too much advertising.

So far there haven't been any substantial discussions about the content
of the links in the KB, no arguments or philosophical debates. And
that's how I think this project would best operate. People of course
have strong views on this subject; and for some it's more personal than
others. And there's a [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/andy5995/mhwkb/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
to help make things especially clear.

And of course, every project needs document editors. :)
